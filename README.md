# ARGUS
This is My Personal Attempt on Argus

This is a PoC - refer to the forked project to see how the actual development looks like.

Should be close to this one anyways.




# TODO for me to be happy with this PoC

[x] Do a Detailed report showing each requirement, implementation, attestation, and artifacts(logs)
[] Add a 'report' command where report types can be specified, eventually files. Let attest command only with summary
[] Make a dependency report where parents status are flagged by the looks of their children status.
[] Implement three use cases using the system as is - see what do I need to change still
